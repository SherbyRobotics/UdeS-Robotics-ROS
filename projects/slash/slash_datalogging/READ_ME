*----------------BAG TO XLSX LAUNCH FILE INSTRUCTIONS-------------*

1. Start by running the closed_loop_and_log.launch file in a terminal
2. A bag file is created at ~/projects/slash/slash_datalogging/bagfiles/ with the name DataBag_AAAA-MM-JJ-HH-MM-SS.bag recording ALL topics that are being plublished.
3. To convert the bag file to a xlsx file, copy the name of the bag file and run the following command in a terminal:

   roslaunch slash_master bag_to_xlsx.launch BagName:=(paste the bagfile name here *without .bag*) XlsxName:=DataXlsx_AAAA-MM-JJ-HH-MM-SS

4. The xlsx file is now created at ~/projects/slash/slash_datalogging/xlsxfiles/   




NOTE I: A few rows at the end of the xlsx file might have been created while the node is getting killed. You might want to delete these rows.
NOTE II: You might want to play around with the datalog.py script to output the desired topics to the xlsx file. You can find the script here: ~/projects/slash/slash_datalogging/src/
